  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Tristan O'Neil. I was born in Randolph, Vermont on March
  20th 1988 (remember this so you can send me cake). I have two parents (duh) and
  two sisters, seven and nine years older than me, so really I have three mothers
  and a father :)</p>

  <p>I now live in Fairfax, Vermont with my lovely wife and my adoring pet <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebelung" target="_blank">Nebelung</a>
  (cat). Professionally I've been developing web applications top to bottom for
  the past five years or so using mostly Ruby and JavaScript. I have a background
  in design and love clean, simple and well tested code. Non-professionally I run
  almost every weekday and enjoy the great Vermont outdoors:
  snowboarding, snowshoeing, hiking and paddle boating (which is totally a
  sport).</p>
